# AngularJS Desserts

A simple project to demonstrate AngularJS routing and controllers.

The controller contains a simple array. Additional elements can be created, and existing elements can be edited or deleted.

The project demonstrates to students how to use the id as a parameter, the $routeParams function, the $location function and $scope.

The site is live here: https://lechien73.github.io/AngularJSDesserts/

To use the code locally or in Cloud9, change the `<base href="/AngularJSDesserts/">` parameter back to `<base href="/">` and change the links in home.html and controller.js.
